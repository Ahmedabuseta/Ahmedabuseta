# üë©‚Äçüíª Ahmed Abusetta (amd_6)

As a software engineer, I am passionate about staying up-to-date with the latest technologies and tools in the industry. I am always on the lookout for opportunities to learn, grow, and expand my skill set.

I am proficient in JavaScript and TypeScript and have extensive experience working with React and Redux. I have also worked with  Sass, Tailwind CSS, and other front-end technologies.

I am a strong communicator and a collaborative team player and enjoy working in a fast-paced environment. I am also comfortable working independently and taking ownership of projects. I am constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow as a software engineer.

One of my greatest strengths is my ability to learn quickly and adapt to new technologies and tools. I am always looking for ways to expand my skill set and stay on top of the latest trends in the industry.

I am also committed to writing clean, maintainable, and efficient code. I understand the importance of code quality and strive to produce code that is easy to read, understand, and maintain.

Outside of work, I enjoy contributing to open-source projects and participating in coding communities. I believe in the importance of giving back to the tech community and helping others learn and grow.

Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me. I look forward to the opportunity to work with you and contribute my skills and knowledge to your team.
